# hello-world
My name is Mica Horton. I have many projects going on. This learning Arduino/Github thing, practicing my drawing and painting skills, and working on my personal website (which includes documenting the marshmallow toaster I made.) Next year, I plan to learn Autodesk which should add to my portfolio.
